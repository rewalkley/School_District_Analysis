# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assist the school board in removing all 9th grade reading and math grades from Thomas High School, as they appear to have been altered. The school board does not want to remove all grades from all schools, so it has asked to only remove those grades and continue with the findings from the test results.

The goal is to determine fund allocation to the schools based on performance.
